# DNA
A Python 3 program that takes in a CSV file of people and how long a Short Tandem Repeat (STR) of DNA is. A Short Tandem Repeat is a large sequence of repeated DNA sequences. For example, AACT is a DNA sequence, but an STR of that sequence with a length of 5 would be AACTAACTAACTAACTAACT. The program will only output the name of the person whose STR data matches exactly with the DNA sequence from the text file. If an STR is one sequence longer than the data says it should be, then it won't output that person.

## Usage
To run the program, you must use the command `python dna.py csv file` where csv is the CSV file that contains the information about the people and the length of the STRs, and file is a text file (.txt) that contains one large DNA sequence. I included a sample CSV file and txt file to test this out.
